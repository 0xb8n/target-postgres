# Target Postgres

A [Singer](https://singer.io/) postgres target, for use with Singer streams generated by Singer taps.

## Features

- Creates SQL tables for [Singer](https://singer.io) streams
- Denests objects flattening them into the parent object's table
- Denests rows into separate tables
- Adds columns and sub-tables as new fields are added to the stream JSON Schema

## Usage

Create a config file with postgres connection information and target postgres schema.

```json
{
  "postgres_host": "locahost",
  "postgres_port": 5432,
  "postgres_database": "my_analytics",
  "postgres_username": "myuser",
  "postgres_password": "1234",
  "postgres_schema": "mytapname"
}
```

Run `target-postgres` against a [Singer](https://singer.io) stream.

```sh
	tap-something | target-postgres --config config.json
```

It ignores "STATE" type Singer messages.

## Limitations
- Requires a JSON Schema for every stream.
- Only string, string with date-time format, integer, number, boolean, object, and array types with or without null are supported. Arrays can have any of the other types listed, including objects as types within items.
